# Summary

This course provides an overview of basic data structure and algorithms for different problems including sorting and searching. As a computer science student, data structure and algorithm is an important topic as it is core of the computer science. Creating appropriate data structures to use them is the key to programming skills. Choosing the correct data structure has an important role in software development as it overall affects the performance and space. Solving problems in an efficient way is the core of the algorithm. There can be lots of ways of solving the same problem but finding the efficient one is important. For example, there are different sorting techniques and we can pick any of them. But choosing the efficient one makes more sense.

There are tons of free videos available on youtube to help understand the algorithm and data structure. I have used it many times when I was unable to understand the problem. Other key sites to follow are StackOverflow and geeksforgeeks. Identifying the proper data structure is an important part of solving the problem.

This is my first algorithm and data structure course, even though I have used these data structures already in java and python. The point is, I am able to understand the theory behind these data structures, and more importantly, I can now create these data structures as needed. I had chosen a binary search tree for my final project, but I had submitted the pseudocode using vector and hash table. With this project, I have confidence in choosing the correct data structure based on the problem.

I have followed the standard naming convention, with lots of useful comments. Writing separate classes for data structure makes the code more maintainable and adaptable.
